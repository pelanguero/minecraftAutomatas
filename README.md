  app:
    image: ghcr.io/sefirosweb/minecraft-legion:latest
    environment:
      SERVER: localhost # Minecraft Server
      PORT: 25565 # Minecraft Port
      MASTERS: player1,player2 # Names of master players, separated with comma
      WEB_SERVER_PASSWORD: admin # Password to login into front end

      CUSTOM_START: false # If you want to do some actions before start bot, you can put here your own custom.js file (used for logging into servers)
      ORIGIN_CORS: "*" # To avoid CORS enter here your public domain

    volumes:
      - "./botConfig:/app/core/botConfig"
      - "./custom_start:/app/core/custom_start"

```
## Need to do actions before start bot?
If you need to do some actions before start bot for example login, or move into some hall you can do this:

1ยบ) In .env file change to true the variable: `CUSTOM_START`

2ยบ) On start bot they create automatically a folder with file: `custom_start\custom.js`

There put all you need to do before bot starts, the function "starts" must be return a promise, when the promise is resolve all bot behavior configuration will be started


# TODO

- Optimize Sorter Job, need too many interaction with chests for sort all the items
- Add custom Sort Items in chest, based on... any idea?
- Add more behavior into Sorter Job, -> Craft items? if detect in chests no have enough of XXX items then craft it if they can? (Example swords?)
- Make an Archer Job ( During how to have this behavior similar to guard job? )
- Optimize combat Guard Job ( combat creepers, PVP, destroy shields)
- Add Job builder! based on mineflayer-builder & Schematichs
- Add placing torchs
- Check some bugs with mining job when have a too many lava or water
- Add bodyguards

Please keep calm. I'm working hard on this project :D
