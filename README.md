# minecraftLegion

Minecraft multipurpose bot

This project are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer">mineflayer</a> & PrismarineJS repository

This program is part of the 3 of this project,
Each part can be run independently,
The other 2 parts are <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebServer">minecraftLegionWebServer</a> & <a href="https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient">minecraftLegionWebClient</a>

I recommend using the other two modules to help the bots communicate and take commands through the WebUI.

## Install:

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) version 14+
- go to the directory which you want to install into
- run `npm i minecraftlegion` on command prompt
- make a new file called config.js with the fields shown below

Edit config.js

```js
const config = {
  server: "127.0.0.1", // Minecraft Server
  port: "", // Minecraft Port
  masters: [{ name: "PlayerName" }, { name: "SecondPlayerName" }], // Is requeried for manage the bot in game, *offline mode
  webServer: "http://localhost", // minecraftLegionWebServer Web - Optional
  webServerPort: "3000", // minecraftLegionWebServer PORT - Optional
};
module.exports = config;
```

To run a single bot:

    node start_bot.js BotName

To use [minecraftLegionWebServer](https://github.com/coolbot123/minecraftLegionWebServer)

    node index.js

This method connects automatically to minecraftLegionWebServer, and via the web, you can add bots/disconnects and manage the behavior.

To manage bots v√≠a web go to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sefirosweb/minecraftLegionWebClient">minecraftLegionWebClient</a> to see more!

## Usage of commands in chat:

First, activate the bot attention "hi namebot" or "hi all" to start all bots simultaneously.

- `hi nameBot`

Make the bot/s follow you.

- `come`

Make the bot/s stand in the current position.

- `stay`

Start memorizing the positions used to save the way to chests or patrol (get the bots to follow you around)

- `set start way`

Save patrol, used for guard job (use command `set start way` before this one)

- `set save patrol`

For set max distance to attack mobs or players

- `set distance 30`

For set mode (pvp / pve / none), if bots are connected to minecraftLegionWebServer it wont attack other bots

- `set mode pvp`

Set job (Currently only finished Guard)

- `set job guard`

To help other bots in combat (need use minecraftLegionWebServer)

- `set help true`

to finish commands

- `bye`

For mining xyz_start xyz_end start_horientantion vertically / horizontalle
set miner x y z x y z x+ horizontally

# Current Jobs

- Guard
  - Do a patrol for look near enemies
- Miner
  - Make a tunel or hole
- Farmer
  - Do placing plants and sapling trees
  - Potatoes, Carrots, Wheat, Melon, Pumpkin, Sweet berries..
  - Sapling Trees -> Woodcutter
- Breeder
  - Feed animals! all types!
  - When there is surplus, sacrifice the surplus
- Sorter Job
  - The bot search all nearest chest and they sort all items based on ID item
  - Also send to the server and other bots you have in each chest, NOW ALL BOTS GO DIRECTLY TO THE CHEST THAT STORES THE ITEM!

# TODO

- Optimize Sorter Job, need too many interaction with chests for sort all the items
- Add custom Sort Items in chest, based on... any idea?
- Add more behavior into Sorter Job, -> Craft items? if detect in chests no have enough of XXX items then craft it if they can? (Example swords?)
- Make an Archer Job ( During how to have this behavior similar to guard job? )
- Optimize combat Guard Job ( combat creepers, PVP, destroy shields)
- Check day/night for sleep any sleep function? Add "general config" for send all bots to sleep for all jobs
- Add Job builder! based on mineflayer-builder & Schematichs
- Add placing torchs
- Check some bugs with mining job when have a too many lava or water
- Add a robust documentation =P
- Think about chat commands, currently it is faster / comfortable with the front end, but if anyone wants to configure all boot via chat commands?
- Add back guard

Please keep calm. I'm working hard on this project :D
